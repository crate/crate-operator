Contributing
============

Thank you for your interest in contributing.

This document is a guideline. Don't worry about getting everything perfect.
We are happy to work with you on your contribution.

`Upvoting existing issues <#upvoting-issues>`_, `reporting new issues
<#reporting-issues>`_, or `giving feedback <#tell-us-about-your-experience>`_
about your experience are the easiest ways to contribute.

We also accept pull requests for changes to the code and to the documentation.
For more information on how to do this, read our `developer guide`_.

If you have any questions, please reach out via any of our `support channels`_.


Upvoting Issues
---------------

An easy way to contribute is to upvote existing issues that are relevant to
you. This will give us a better idea what is important for you and other users.

Please avoid content-less ``+1`` comments but instead use the emoji reaction to
upvote with a üëç. This allows people to `sort issues by reaction`_ and doesn't
spam the maintainers.


Reporting Issues
----------------

Before you report an issue, please `search the existing issues`_ to make sure
someone hasn't already reported it.

When reporting a new issue, include as much detail as possible. Please include:

- What you did, what happened, and what you expected to happen

- Steps to reproduce the issue

- Which CrateDB Kubernetes Operator version you're using

- Which Kubernetes version you're using

- Logs or stacktraces

  - For example, operator can be started with an environment variable
    ``CRATEDB_OPERATOR_LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG`` to get a full list of its interactions
    with Kubernetes.


Tell us about your experience
=============================

You don't have to create a detailed bug report or request a new feature to make
a valuable contribution. Giving us feedback about your experience with the
CrateDB Kubernetes Operator is incredibly valuable as well. Please `get in
touch`_ with us to tell us what you like and don't like about it.
