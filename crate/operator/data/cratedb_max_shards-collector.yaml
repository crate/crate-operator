# This metric only publishes the configuration set at the cluster level of the maximum number of shards a node can
# handle.
# This metric is to be used to alert us when the current number of shards per node surpasses a certain threshold.
# Please note the calculation happens at Prometheus level and not here so that the metrics can be kept generic
# and changed without the need of redeploying the operators.
# The other required metric with the current number of shards nodes are handling is extracted via JMX.
