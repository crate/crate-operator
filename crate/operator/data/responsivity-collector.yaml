# This metric is intended to alert us to when CrateDB Cloud clusters are unresponsive.
# This uses a query which involves communication with other nodes to test
# that the communication between the nodes work.
# (In this case, all that contain any shards)
#
# If nodes are not reachable the query would fail.
# (Other queries like on `sys.cluster` or `information_schema` can be served
# by a single node *without* communication with other nodes)
metrics:
- help: "Indicates whether the CrateDB node is responding to queries. Will not return if the node is stuck."
