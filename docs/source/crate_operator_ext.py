    Remove or resolve references to third party packages.

    - The ``kubernetes_asyncio`` package doesn't provide any reference
      documentsion for its API. To allow nitpicking on missing references we
      take the approach to exclude all ``kubernetes_asyncio`` references.

    - The ``aiopg`` package uses top-level imports (e.g. ``from aiopg import
        Connection``) and writes the documentation as such. But the actual
        classes and functions are defined in e.g. ``aiopg.conection`` or
        ``aiopg.cursor``. We rewrite the references accordingly.
